[How to Build]
You can compile .Net Standard and .Net Core projects directly on Windows.
Copy built output to linux and execute them.

[Runtime Environment]
On Linux, you have to install .Net Core runtime before execute your code.
You can search it with keywork "dotnet".

Install Steps:
step1 => istall Microsoft package signing key
	wget https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/18.04/packages-microsoft-prod.deb -O packages-microsoft-prod.deb
	sudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb

step2 => update your respository. 
	apt update

step3 => install runtime (choose version and runtime you need, following are just example)
	apt install aspnetcore-runtime-3.1
	apt install dotnet-runtime-3.1

you can search related package by "apt search dotnet"

[My Experiment VM]
Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Server-x64, installed dotnet-runtime-3.1

[Something Intreseting]
I compiled my "hello world" project on my Win7 PC.
It generated several files:
	HelloWorld.deps.json
	HelloWorld.dll
	HelloWorld.exe
	HelloWorld.pdb
	HelloWorld.runtimeconfig.dev.json
	HelloWorld.runtimeconfig.json

On my VM, I tried to run HelloWorld.exe but faild.
execution command:
	dotnet HelloWorld.exe

Then, I tried to execute HelloWorld.dll.... it works!
It printed out my "Hello World"....
